# Psychic-Game
This game allows users to guess which randomized letter the app chose. When guessed right, the game restarts without refreshing the page, having the win count increase by one. If the player guesses wrong, the letter typed will show where it says "guesses so far." If guesses run out (9 in total, will decrease by 1 each guess used), then the loss count goes up by one, and the game restarts. 

This project is useful because it shows the basic javascript commands in relation to the HTML file.
